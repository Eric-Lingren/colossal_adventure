Colossal Adventure is a text based RPG that can only be run in a Node.js terminal environment.  My inspiration for this game was the classic 1980's rpg ZORK, however it is far less involved.  Please feel free to download and play!  

This project has several dependencies:
  -  Readline Sync for handle user input and interactions with the game in the console
  -  Play-sound is able to add sound effects and music to play through the terminal
  - Sleep delays some of the text output and ASCII ar effects in the game
  
Enjoy your time in my labrynth!
